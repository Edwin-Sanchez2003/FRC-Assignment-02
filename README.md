# Menu Code Cleanup
The Menu class works alright, but it's a bit hard to read. Why don't we clean it up? Make a copy of the `Menu.java` file and re-write it so that it is easier to read. Use your knowledge of *Abstraction* (through creating functions), *Naming Conventions*, *Commenting*, and any other skills you may know to help clean up the code. Remember to make sure it still works the same as before when you're done!

## Things to remember:
### Consistency is Key.
Make sure that when you choose a naming convention or style when writing code, try to be consistent about it. If you follow a pattern, it helps others to understand you code once they get a feel for what you consistently do. For instance, if you always use *get* in your function names when the function's job is to get a variable and return it, others will quickly be able to pick up on that pattern and understand other functions easier. (ex: `getPlayerName()` and `getTotalPoints()`. In both cases, *get* signifies getting some value from the function.)

### Comment your Code!
Leave notes for your fellow developer. Don't put unhelpful comments, such as comments that simply repeat the names of functions. Try to give a description that reflects the goals of that part of your code.

### Use Naming Conventions.
A common naming convention in Java is Camel-Casing (ex: `getPlayerName()` or `dogName`). Also make sure your names are **descriptive**. A variable, function, or class's name should accurately reflect what it is or what it does. You will thank yourself later when you use names like `playerScore` instead of `x`, as one makes it very clear as to what it stores while the other will send you on a scavenger hunt to figure out what it is used for.

### Use Abstraction.
When things feel too cluttered, its probably because it is. Use functions to break your program down into bite-sized pieces. This will make it easier to understand each individual step in your code, as it is in its own little bubble. This can also help when you need to do the same job over and over again - just reuse the function. Be careful to make sure your abstractions are meaningful though; sometimes splitting up a task into too many pieces makes it harder to read!

## Assignment:
Now that you know how to clean up code and format it to be easier to work with, its time to get your hands dirty. Create your own `Menu` class (you can use my code, but if you want to challenge yourself, try to write it from scratch). Change the tasks that the menu lets you do.

### Goals:
* Create 3 new tasks for the menu.
* At least two variables need to interact in some way (like how we use the dogâ€™s name when we play fetch with it).
* Use good naming conventions, good comments, and reasonable abstractions to make your code easier to read.

### Learning Goals:
* Get comfortable with programming (and debugging when you run into issues).
* Practice designing a solution to a problem before you go to write code. 
  * What is your project's goal? How do you plan to accomplish it? 
  * What individual steps do you need to have in your code?
  * What kind of abstractions can you make to simplify the process?
* Practice using variables, functions, control logic (for loop, if condition, etc.).
* Practice writing comments and using good naming conventions.
